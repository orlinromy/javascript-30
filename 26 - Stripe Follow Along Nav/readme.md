# Day 26 - Stripe Follow Along Dropdown 
### Objective
Create a Stripe website navigation dropdown clone

### Notes
- [From [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26/)] In classic function expression, `this` is bound to the context it's which it is called. Hence, you need to pass the `this` context to the function using `bind`. On the other hand, `this` is lexically bound when arrow function is used. This means the function will use `this` from the code that contains the arrow function 
- Frameworks like Angular and React animate things by applying 2 different classes when somethings enters or leaves and use CSS to stage the move


### Extra Challenge
As mentioned in the video, create the drop animation when hovering on the navigation for the first time
