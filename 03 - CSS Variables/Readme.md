# Day 3 - CSS Variables
### Objective
To change the style of an image (spacing, blur, and base color)

### Notes
- `data-*` attributes can be accessed using JavaScript using `this.dataset.*`
- `document.querySelectorAll()` doesn't return an array, but a NodeList
- To access the root of the document, you can use `document.documentElement`
- To be able to handle "real-time" changes, you can add an event listener during a mouse 

### Extra Challenge
