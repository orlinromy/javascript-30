# Day 14 - Objects and Arrays - Reference VS Copy
### Objective 
Learn object and array "pass by reference" (reference) and "pass by value" (copy)  

### Notes
- A good explanation for pass by value and pass by reference: https://www.educative.io/edpresso/pass-by-value-vs-pass-by-reference. Basically, pass by value means that the actual value is copied in memory, while pass by reference means that the "reference" or "pointer" (or "address") is copied in memory
