    /* ---------------------------------------- Array ---------------------------------------- */
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // numbers
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // returns 100 100
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2) // returns 200 100

    // string
    let name = 'Wes'
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2) // returns Wes Wes
    name = 'Wesley'
    console.log(name, name2) // returns Wesley Wes
    
    // The above are examples of pass by value

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array? --> both team and players last member is changed to Lux, instead of just team's last member that is changed to Lux

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team4 = [...players]

    // or another way...
    let team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    /* ---------------------------------------- Objects ---------------------------------------- */
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // when you update this, both the Object person and the Object captain's number are updated to 99 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12}); // take an empty object, pass in Object person, then update the property


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // Our object:
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes Bos', 
      age: 30,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wes.developer'
      }
    }

    // If we copy the object and modify the twitter account ... :
    let dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    // ... this will update the twitter account for both cap2 and wes to "@coolman". As mentioned, this is because the copy method here is only 1 level deep.

    // "cheat" method (not recommended):
    let dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
    dev2.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    // In this cheat method, parse the JSON as a string, then parse back to JSON. When you update cap3 twitter account, wes twitter account is not affected.
