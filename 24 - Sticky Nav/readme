# Day 24 - Sticky Nav
### Objective
Fix the position of the navigation when scrolling down the document

### Notes
- When you set an element position as `fixed`, the element no longer takes the space, which causes reflow in the document - the next element will take up the space given up by the element with `position: fixed`. To avoid reflow, offset the space taken by the fixed element.
- Cool trick: you can configure the CSS style of some classes by adding the added class + the class that you want to change when the class exists in the stylesheet
