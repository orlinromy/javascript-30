# Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
### Objective
Use CSS Flexbox to make the container appear side-by-side from left to right and make the panel larger and add animation when clicked

### Notes
- `display: flex` to use CSS flexbox
- Use `flex: n` (n is any number) to set how the items will grow
- `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center` for center alignment 
- `transform: translateY(-100%)` and `transform: translateY(100%)` to put the items offscreen. 
- Use `transitionend` event listener to trigger something after the transition of the item is completed
