# JavaScript30
This is a repository to store all JavaScript practice codes from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com). In addition to the basic requirement from the course, I have added several extra challenges for myself to practice more, find out more, and learn more. Additional challenges are described in each practice folder readme file. Check out the [website](https://javascript30.com) to start your own #JavaScript30! 

## Resources
All resources are taken from [JavaScript30 Starter Files](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).
